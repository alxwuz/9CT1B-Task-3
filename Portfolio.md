## PMI
Plus: Improves hand-eye coordination and cognitive abilities while developing their motor skills, as well as reaction times and problem-solving skills.

Minus: Can bee too addicting for the user and they may want to play the game instead of doing other useful things.

Interesting: Making this game introduces a very old genre that has not been one of the popular genres for a while, so making this game will introduce a new gaming category to players.

| Game | Plus | Minus | Interesting |
|:---- |:---- |:----- |:----------- |
| Roblox | In Roblox, there is an endless range of games to play, along with a good community, where you can never get bored of the gameplay. | Players are vunerable to cyberbullying, as there is an in-game chat were people can communicate, and a lot scams where people can lose a lot of things. There is also a lot of copies (rip-offs) of other famous games and characters (normally copyrighted), such as copies of Fortnite, Minecraft, even Windows. | There is an economy on Roblox where you can buy and sell items, possibly making a large sum of Robux (the currency for Roblox) and profiting off of it.
| Elden Ring | Elden Ring has an extremely fun and entertaining storyline, with lots of good gameplay and a huge open-world map, with a ton of things to explore and play. | The game is sort of repetetive, a lot of bosses and environments are copy and pasted, making most structures and dungeons look the same. The game is also very expensive, making some people not wanting to purchase the game, resorting to other ways, such as pirating or buying a cheaper third-party copy. | Elden Ring was the winner for Game of The Year in 2022. It also has one of the best graphics out of all the games, looking extremely realistic on maximum settings, while also needing a very powerful computer to run it at a stable frame rate.
| Forza Horizon 5 | Forza Horizon 5 is one of the top car games out there, having a "simcade" (simulator and arcade) physics engine, making it very engaging with a detailed and unique map. There is a wide variety of cars you can pick to drive, with lots of customization, including the performance and aestethics. | A bad thing about Forza Horizon 5 is that it may be a little bit too "easy". This is not in terms of driving skill, but the progression. It is very easy to get your dream car (you already start with 5 A grade cars), making people not being able to "grind" for their car. This can make people play the game less, as there is not much to progress on apart from doing races for money. | An interesting thing the game is that it has seasons, and the map adapts to the seasons. For example, if it is winter, then it will snowy and cold, which makes the user experience more fun. The map is also based on the country of Mexico, having some of the same roads and structures, making it the largest map in the Forza Horizon series

## Identifying and Defining
### Need
To improve young teen's hand-eye coordination and cognitive abilities while developing their motor skills, as well as offering a fun and entertaining way to improve essential developmental skills, such as reaction times, problem-solving skills.

### Problem Statement
Lots of teenagers struggle with conentrating due to their short attention spans, which is caused from short-form videos such as Tiktok, Youtube Shorts and WeChat Channels. By making a very interesting game, users will want to interact with the challenges within the game, resulting in a repaired attention span, allowing them to focus in other aspects of life, like school.

### Skill Development
To develop the skills in Unity required to create the game, I would complete the 2D Rougelike tutorial, which can teach me the basics of the game, allowing me to expand further and exploring better game features.
