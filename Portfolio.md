### Problem Statement
Young children often need fun and educational activities that enhance their motor skills and hand-eye coordination. A ball rolling game that requires players to navigate obstacles and solve puzzles by tilting or controlling the movement of a ball can help develop these skills while keeping them entertained.

### Skill Development
To develop the skills in Unity required to create the game, I would complete this roll-a-ball Unity tutorial.

## Requirements Outline
### Processing
**Task:** 
Describe what processing needs to happen once the inputs are received. What calculations or logic will your program follow?

**Instructions:**
Outline how the system will process the inputs.
Example: The program will check for collisions, calculate the new position of the player, and update the game score accordingly.

### Outputs
**Task:** 
Define what the user will see or experience after processing.

**Instructions:**
List the outputs, such as screen updates, sounds, or messages.
Example: The game will display the player's score, character's position, and a game-over message.


### Transmission
**Task:**
Determine if there will be any data transmission requirements.

**Instructions:**
Will your project require network communication or multiplayer support? If yes, describe it.
Example: The game will send score data to an online leaderboard.

### Storage
**Task:**
Identify any data that needs to be saved, either locally or in the cloud.

**Instructions:**
Consider if the project will store game progress, user settings, or other important information.
Example: The game will store the user's progress and high score locally.
